## ðŸ’¼ Business Case and Requirement

You are a Data Analyst working for an e-commerce company named X. You are tasked with preparing a presentation to present an overview of the company's business and operations to date for Sales and Operations Managers. 

### The presentation should include at a minimum the following information: 
- Business overview. 
- Customer satisfaction.  
- 2 to 3 areas of recommendation (areas) where the company can improve.

### Some additional information for the case study:
- Since there is only data up to 2018, we will assume that it is currently September 2018 (data after September 2018 you can ignore).
- The company is based in the US, but incorporated in Brazil (that's why some information is written in Portuguese).
